    <h2 class="top-make">How to make great cheeseburgers</h2> 
    <p>If a BBQ isn‚Äôt an option, switch your range hood to max and cook on the stove in
        a heavy cast iron skillet. Give your non-stick pan the night off 
        it doesn‚Äôt cope well with high heat cooking!</p>
    <h2>1. The cheeseburger patty</h2>
    <img src="images/make-burger.webp" alt="not loding...">
    <ol>
     <li><h3 class="dis">Form patties -</h3><p class="dis">Separate the beef into 4 mounds, or 8 if making double 
    cheeseburgers. Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties 
    not rock hard ones!) then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger 
    bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.
    As noted above, I like using buns that are maximum 10 cm / 4‚Ä≥ wide so the patty is 
    proportionally a good size and thickness. If your buns are much larger, I‚Äôd recommend 
    using more beef else you‚Äôll end up with wafer-thin patties, or patties that are way 
    smaller than your buns!</p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Tip #1 ‚Äì Dent your patty in the middle.</h3>
    <p class="dis">Thinning the centre of the patty compensates for the tendency of the patty to dome up in
        the middle as it cooks. It also reduces the overall patty shrinkage during cooking. 
        Doing this means there‚Äôs no need to squash the burger to keep it flat and even as it 
        cooks (losing precious juices!) Use your fingers or the back of your hand to press a 
        dent into the centre of the patty. A neat trick I picked up from Bobby Flay many years 
        ago!</p></li>   
    <li><h3 class="dis">Photo 3: The dent ‚Äì </h3><p class="dis">Here‚Äôs what it looks like. 
    It doesn‚Äôt need to be even or deep, just a slight inwards curve, so the patty is shaped a 
    bit like a red blood cell.</p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Tip #2 ‚Äì Salt JUST before cooking.</h3><p class="dis">My second key tip 
        is to only salt the patty just before cooking. If you salt your patty ahead of time and
        leave it sitting around, the cooked patty ends up much firmer. This is because the salt
        acts on the meat proteins and changes their chemistry. Go ahead and give it a go, if
        you want to see it for yourself! üôÇ I salt mine while the skillet is pre-heating.</p>
</ol>
<h2>2. Cooking the patties</h2>
<img src="images/make-Cheeseburger.webp" alt="not loding...">
<ol>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Cast iron skillet ‚Äì</h3><p class="dis"> Preheat oil in a heavy-based cast iron skillet over 
        high heat until it is very, very hot. Why a cast-iron skillet? Because it‚Äôs made for 
        high heat fast cooking so we can get a great caramelised dark brown crust without 
        overcooking the inside. This burger patty cooks in 3 minutes flat!</p>
        <h3 class="dis">Don‚Äôt have a cast-iron skillet?</h3> <p class="dis"> You can use a non-stick frying pan but just heat the oil
        until hot, not smoking. Don‚Äôt cook it as aggressively as I do in the recipe video below 
        (ie. very, very hot skillet) or you may damage the non-stick coating. You probably won‚Äôt 
        get quite the same colour on the crust but avoid the temptation to cook for longer as you‚Äôll 
        end up with overcooked insides.</p><br>
        <li><h3 class="dis">3-minute cook ‚Äì </h3> <p class="dis"> Place 2 or 4 patties in the skillet (depending how many. fit)
            and cook the first side for 1 1/2 minutes, pressing down LIGHTLY with a spatula. Note the
             emphasis on ‚Äúlightly‚Äù! Nobody likes dense, hard patties where all the juice has been
              squeezed out during the cooking phase!</p></li>
    <li> <h3 class="dis">Flip & cheese ‚Äì </h3> <p class="dis" >Flip the burgers then
         immediately top with cheese and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes.</p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Melted!  </h3> <p class="dis">And look at that. 
        A perfectly cooked patty and melted cheese draped over it. A flawless burger!</p>
    </li>

 <h2>3. Assembling cheeseburgers</h2>
 <img src="images/How-to-assemble.webp" alt="not lodding..">
 <p>This is the order in which I like to build burgers because I think it‚Äôs the most
     structurally stable. Anybody who‚Äôs bitten into a giant burger only to have a slice
      of tomato jettisoned out the other end knows exactly what I‚Äôm talking about!</p>
 <ol>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Toast the buns</h3>
        <p class="dis">under the grill/broiler for a few minutes until light golden. 
        I only do the cut face because I like to keep the round outside faces soft. 
        Using your BBQ? Just pop them face down straight onto the grill. </p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Smear with sauce of choice.</h3>
        <p class="dis">In the photo above I‚Äôm using my homemade tomato chutney burger sauce and in
        the video you‚Äôll also see me using my creamy pink Special Burger Sauce. 
        No need to choose ‚Äì sometimes I use both.</p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Lettuce ‚Üí tomato ‚Üí patty ‚Äì </h3>
        <p class="dis"> I put lettuce down first because it kind of 
        ‚Äústicks‚Äù to the sauce followed by tomato then the patty (or patties!)</p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Gherkins ‚Üí onion ‚Äì</h3><p class="dis">Next, gherkins are scattered across the cheese 
        (they kind of naturally adhere which is nice) followed by onion.</p></li>
    <li><h3 class="dis">Sauce on lid ‚Äì</h3><p class="dis">Finally I also usually smear the sauce on the lid though if 
        I‚Äôm feeling extra saucy I‚Äôll spoon additional sauce straight onto the burger stack 
        instead or (gasp shock horror!) as well. üòá</p></li>
    <li><p>Jam the lid on top then demolish your burger!</p></li>
